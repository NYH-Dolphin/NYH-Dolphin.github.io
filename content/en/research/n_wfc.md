## 1. What is Wave Function Collapse (WFC)?

**Wave Function Collapse (WFC)** algorithm has been introduced by [Maxim Gumin](https://github.com/mxgmn) for Texture Synthesis. However, it quickly gained a lot of attention in **Procedural Content Generation** (especially scene/level generation). It can be used not only for 2D scene generation, but also for more complex game scene generation in 3D.

If you're wondering how exactly this algorithm works, Gumin's [Github repository](https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file) has a lot of examples explaining it. In addition, you can also check this [Demo](https://oskarstalberg.com/game/wave/wave.html) to see their visualization of WFC.

## 2. What is this paper about?

This paper optimizes the **Time Complexity** of the WFC from exponential level $O(C^n)$ to **polynomial level** $O(n)$.  We propose an optimized algorithm: **Nested Wave Function Collapse (N-WFC)** to address the limitations of WFC's current ability to produce only small-scale content. We provide the **pseudo-code of the algorithm framework** and the **tileset norms (complete and sub-complete tileset)** required to realize the algorithm.

We also further prove that our optimized algorithm has good **characteristics** of:

- **Infinity**: theoretically it can generate infinite content
- **Aperiodicity**: under a large-scale generation, the generated content of the algorithm will not be repeated
- **Determinacy**: it will not backtrack due to conflicts

## 3. Awesome Experiments

We experimented the feasibility of our algorithm in two classic games, **Super Mario Bros** and **Carcassonne**. The results of the algorithm are amazing. üòÆ 

The advantage for WFC is that it **decouples the design and art of the tileset from the generative logic**. Neither need be restricted by the other. In other words, tiles of different artistic designs are equivalent for the algorithm!
