## <center>😊About Me</center>

<img src="/images/about/myphoto.png" style="zoom:50%;" />

Welcome to my personal website. My name is <u>Yuhe NIE</u>. I was born in <u>Shenzhen, China</u>. 

I would be happy if you could call me <u>Dolphin</u>🐬!

I got my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology from the Southern University of Science and Technology.  I am currently pursuing my master's degree in Integrated Design & Media at New York University. At present, I am studying and researching Procedural Content Generation (PCG) and Game Artificial Intelligence in the Game Innovation Lab, under the supervision of Professor Julian Togelius in the Computer Science Department of New York University. I am also taking cross cross-disciplinary courses ranged from computer science 💻, game development 🎮, digital media 🕹️ and other related courses. I'm also actively self-learning game development. I've developed a lot of games using Unity, Unreal Engine, and Renpy, which you can find on my Itch games website.

I love watching Japanese animations and comics🎏 (Recently, I also like Chinese animations). I have watched animations for more than 15 years! They support me a lot.  If you are an university student, I sincerely recommend [The Tatami Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tatami_Galaxy) and [Run with the Wind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_with_the_Wind) to you, in addition to that, I usually recommend [From the New World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_the_New_World_(novel)), [Made in Abyss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Made_in_Abyss), [Land of the Lustrous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_of_the_Lustrous), and [Attack on Titian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_on_Titan). I also like [NARUTO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naruto), [Neon Genesis Evangelion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neon_Genesis_Evangelion), [Mo Dao Zu Shi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mo_Dao_Zu_Shi). During my spare time, I also like design👩‍💻, painting🎨, singing🎤 and playing table tennis🏓.

I am engaged in technology that allows people to create all kinds of interesting things in a virtual world. There are so many things people can do in the virtual world that I'm exploring little by little... 🤔
