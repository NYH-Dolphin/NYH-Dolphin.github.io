      <description>1. Why not traditional PCG? Traditional PCG algorithms are based on specific heuristic algorithms. Although it can be modified and designed specifically for the requirements of the development team, it still relies on the heuristic experience of a large number of programmers and designers (fine-tune parameters, design fitness functions, human-algorithm interactions,etc).
Multi-modal PCG (MMPCG), leverage the similar ability as Generative AI to allow designer generates the map by simply typing prompt.</description>

      <description>This research was first accepted by IEEE Conference on Games 2023 and was extended to journal paper for IEEE Transactions on Games 2024. We won the Best Paper AwardüèÜ for IEEE Conference on Games! Congratulations to all the authors and their contributions to this paper! Thanks to NYU Tandon Game Innovation Lab for supporting the publication of this paper!
 1. What is Wave Function Collapse (WFC)? Wave Function Collapse (WFC) algorithm has been introduced by Maxim Gumin for Texture Synthesis.</description>
